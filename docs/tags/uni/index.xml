      <description>Not much to write about this lecture since it was mostly an introduction and generic overview of the field. The lecturant was also half an hour late so that didn&amp;rsquo;t help either. There won&amp;rsquo;t be posts about this course if the input does not increase :P</description>

      <description>Continuing the repetition of some Algorithm lectures we went over pointers again.
int* pi; // pointer to int value (undefined) char** ppc; // pointer to char pointer (= pointer that points to a pointer pointing to a char :D) int i = 1; pi = &amp;amp;i; // assign address of i to pi int x = 1, y; int* px = &amp;amp;x; // pointer to x int** ppx = &amp;amp;px; // pointer to pointer of x **ppx = *px + 1; // double deferencing via &#39;**&#39;, equals x = x + 1 y = **ppx + 2; // double deferencing via &#39;**&#39;, equals y = x + 2  Now onto some new stuff!</description>

      <title>Operating Systems - Operating System Design</title>
      <link>https://schoettkr.github.io/knowledge-database/uni/os/02_lecture/</link>

      <description>Complex systems consist of single component. Therefore the successfull design of a complex system requires knowledge about the variants and relations of the components.
There are some fundamental, reoccuring concepts when it comes to operating systems:
 virtualization  refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources the things &amp;ldquo;created&amp;rdquo; by virtualizing often don&amp;rsquo;t exist (or not the required amount or in the quality) for example relevant for processes, memory space  concurrency  ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems allows execution without a linear order for example relevant for threads, IPC, resource management  persistence  refers to the characteristic of state that outlives the process that created it achieved in practice by storing the state as data in computer data storage for example relevant for file systems, files, nonvolatile (persistent) storage   This course will mainly deal with virtualization and concurrency since persistence is a subject of the database modules.</description>

      <title>Computer Science II - Lecture 01</title>

      <description>Computer Science II basically continues where CS I left off. Both lectures are based on a script that is split into two parts. These weeks lecture introduced pointers. Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it short because there already a lot of posts for lectures regarding pointers on this page :) and at this point is not really a new or special topic.
Pointers Every variable has a memory adress. In case of arrays the base adress of the variable points to the beginning of an array eg the &amp;amp;a is the same adress as &amp;amp;a[0].</description>

      <description>In the first lectures of the datastructures we&amp;rsquo;ll repeat a few things that were already covered in the Algorithm &amp;amp; Programming Lecture so you may want to refer those blog posts as well. After all both courses belong to the same module.
Computational Effort &amp;amp; Complexity To compare datastructures and algorithms in regards to efficiency we need a way to measure the &amp;ldquo;cost&amp;rdquo; / computational effort. This is done by counting the required computing &amp;ldquo;steps&amp;rdquo; (Rechenschritte).</description>

      <description>Although Operating Systems depend on the underlying hardware, there general principles that are common across different operating systems and this is the topic of this course. There are two different ways to &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; an operating system (2 Sichten):
 Top Down View (OS as a virtual machine)  offers an abstract view on the hardware real hardware characteristics are sort of hidden take for example the harddrive and the file system:  real machine (hardware): a sequence of data blocks of fixed size virtual machine: named files of variable size   Bottom Up View (OS as a resource manager)  OS coordinates the access on CPU, Memory, Storage etc.</description>

      <description>This was the first lecture in the new summer semester and therefore it was mostly about organizational stuff. Here are the most important points:
 the exam is gonna be a written one and might be open-book the start of the tutorials will be announced on the course website sometime in April (registration via opal) there are gonna be exercises to hand in  those can be found here  the main programming language used will be python  Fundamental literature:</description>
