      <description>We can achieve the security goals mentioned in the previours lecture by:
 information encryption implementation of authentication establishment of security activities monitoring of the system or the network in terms of attacks continous reduction of weak spots etc    In the data transfer model (2 users communicating) we can distinguish for example two types of attackers:
 passive attacker  can only listen, not manipulate confidentiality threat  active attacker  can listen, change, delete, duplicate threat for confidentiality, integrity and authenticity   The difference between authenticity and liability lays in the focus between internal and external relationships.</description>

      <description>This was the first lecture in the new summer semester and therefore it was mostly about organizational stuff. Here are the most important points:
 the exam is gonna be a written one and might be open-book the start of the tutorials will be announced on the course website sometime in April (registration via opal) there are gonna be exercises to hand in  those can be found here   Distributed Solution Design</description>
