* Storage and memory
Up until now our C programs followed the function model (stateless). Storing data is however required to realise the state model. To store data there are basically two options:
- storing in the file system (good for big data sets but slow)
- storing in memory (faster but limited in some aspects as well)
  
We continue with the latter option (ᵔᴥᵔ).

C is theoretically able to write to and acces every place in memory. Due to the implied dangers of this, most operating systems prevent this to some degree. There are three fundamental methods to reserve (*allocate*) memory:
- (implicit) "named" memory allocation at compile time
-  "anonymous" memory allocation at run time
- parameters which allocate storage at run rime as well
  
The terms "named" and "anonymous" are taken from the lecture script, I don't like them and think they're confusing. As I understand it the first method refers to the memory allocation that happens when you have e.g =int num = 5;= in your code and the compiler allocates/reserves at least 16 bits (2 bytes), while the second method refers to dynamic memory allocation via =malloc()= and =calloc()=. I'm not entirely sure if this is what the professor means xD. 

** Variables
Should the value of a place in memory be modified (purpose of the state model), you speak of (named or anonymous) /variables/. Should the value in memory stay unchanged, then it is a /constant/.
*** Named variables
Named variables in C have to be declared (analogus to functions). The declarations has to contain the type of the variable as well as the name. It is possible to declare multiple variables of the same type together ala =int x, y ,z;=.

When declaring a variable it is possible to also provide a /storage class/ and/or a /type qualifier/. The storage class is declared via one of the following keywors =auto=, =static=, =extern= or =register=. These basically impact the /scope/, /visibility/(?! might be wrong) and the /life time/ of the specific variable.
- =auto= (assumed by default if no other storage class is specified)
  - not often written because it is the default
  - =auto= variables can only be accessed within the block of declaration which defines their scope
  - however they can be accessed outside their scope by using pointers
  - get a garbage value assigned whenever they are declared (without initilization)
- =static=
  - =static= variables preserve their (last) value even after they are out of scope
  - therefore /only initialized once/ and exist until program termination, thus no new memory is allocated because they are not redeclared
  - their scope is local to the function in which they were defined, global static variables can be accesed anywhere
  - are assigned =0= by default from the compiler
- =register=
  - same functionality as auto variables with the difference that the compiler tries to store these variables in the register of the microprocessor, which makes access much faster than that of the variables stored in memory
  - if no free register is available the variable is stored in memory
  - address of register variables is not retrievable using pointers

Type qualifiers are declared via the keywords =const=, =volatile= or =restrict= and give hints to the compiler about the usage of the variables (see "Storage Classes and Storage Types/Attributes" in Lecture 08).

Variables declared outside of any function are /global variables/, while variables declared in blocks (={..}=) are /local variables/. Only with the exception of variables with a storage class of =extern=, variables are also /defined/ when they are /declared/ that means that memory for the varibale is automatically allocated in memory (dont mix this with initializing and/or assigning) without the programmer having to do anything. So the declaration announces the name and the type and definition creates creates the variable thus the memory is allocated and usually this happens at the same time except for when the keyword =extern= is used. (On this from quora: Declaration of a variable specifies its name and datatype. Declaration does not create a variable; it only refers to a variable name and what type of data the variable will hold, so memory is not allocated at the time of declaration. =extern int i; /* Declaration */= Definition creates the variable, so memory is allocated at the time of definition. Declarations also serve as definitions, except when the declaration contains the extern specifier but no initializer.)

When the variable has a storage class of =extern= it is *only declared* but not defined and therefore has to be /globally defined/ (in a different module).

A variable can be assigned a value via =0=, this can also be done when declaring a variable \rightarrow *initilization*.

**** Addresses
Every variable has an address (place in memory where it is stored) that can be retrieved with the =&= "address of" operator
#+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both :results output
 /* addr .c -- address of a variable */
extern printf(char* c, ...);

int main ()
{
int testVar = 42;
printf (" Variable var has the address %p and the value %d\n",
&testVar ,testVar );
return 0;
 }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Variable var has the address 0x7ffc5d3f3694 and the value 42

Actually the identifier of a variable (eg =testVar=) is just a synonym of the address.

**** Pointer
Variables can also hold addresses themselves! The prefix =*= infront of the identifier of a variable indicates a pointer variable. It is essential for the compiler of what this address is built, therefore a pointer is always pointing to another *specific* type. For instance:
- =int *p= \rightarrow pointer that is pointing to an integer type
- =float *p= \rightarrow pointer that is pointing to a float type
- =unsigned int *p= \rightarrow pointer that is pointing to an unsigned integer type
  
If a generic memory address without a specific type shall be used then the base type =void= is used:
- =void *p= pointer that is pointing to an address
- assigning void pointers is compatible to/with all other pointer types (\rightarrow no warnings!)

#+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both :results output
  /* addr2 .c -- pointer to a variable */
  extern printf(char* c, ...);

  int main ()
  {
    int var = 42 , * pvar ;
    pvar = &var ;
    printf (" Variable var has the address %p and the value %d\n", pvar, var);
    printf ("Variable pvar has the address %p and the value %p\n", &pvar , pvar);

    printf ("The value that the pointer stored in pvar points to is %d\n", *pvar);
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Variable var has the address 0x7ffd08a3f97c and the value 42
: Variable pvar has the address 0x7ffd08a3f980 and the value 0x7ffd08a3f97c
: The value that the pointer stored in pvar points to is 42

Example memory representation of the above code (addresses will differ):

A type and its derived type (eg =int= and =int *=) are /different/ types.

As seen in the code example above a pointer can be *dereferenced* via the dereference operator =*=
#+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both :results output
  /* deref .c -- deref a pointer */
  extern printf(char* c, ...);

  int main ()
  {
    int y = 23 , *py = &y ;

    printf("y=%d (at %p)\n" ,*py, py ); /* same effect as printf ("y=%d\n" ,y); */
    ,*py = 42; /* same effect as y=42 */

    printf ("y=%d (at %p)\n", y, &y );
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: y=23 (at 0x7ffeeff30f1c)
: y=42 (at 0x7ffeeff30f1c)
*** Anonymous variables
Anonymous variables in C don't have a name but get memory allocated nevertheless. They are created at /run time/ with functions from the C standard library. Anonymous variables are *not declared*.

More specifically the following functions that are /declared/ in =stdlib.h= are used to allocate memory at run time:
- =void *malloc(size_t size)= \rightarrow reserves =size= bytes in memory (memory allocate)
- =void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size)= \rightarrow reserves =count x size= bytes in memory and initializes them with a value of =0= (count allocate)
  
Both functions retrun the *address* of the anonymous variable.

To find out how much size/space is needed, C's =sizeof= operator comes in handy because the size of eg an =int= is not the same on all systems. It can be used on variables as well as on types and =sizeof(int)= return for example =4=.

The programmer has (in contrast to named variables) manage the scope and lifecycle of anonymous variables. To release the memory that was allocated for an anonymous variable =void free(void*)= is used which takes the address of the anonymous variable.
To be able to do this you of course need the address of the anonymous variable and that is (amongst other reasons) why you should store it somewhere!

#+BEGIN_SRC C :exports both :results output
  /* malloc .c -- anonymous variables */
  extern printf(char* c, ...);
  extern void* malloc(size_t);
  extern void free(void*);

  int main ()
  {
    int * p; // declare pointer to int

    p = malloc(sizeof(int)); // allocate memory for an int and store the returned address of the allocated memory location and store it in p

    ,*p =42 ; // dereference p and store the value 42

    printf(" Pointer p has address %p and points to %p\n", (void*) &p ,(void*)p);
    printf(" Anonymous variable has the value %d which is stored in %p\n", *p, (void*)p);
    free(p); /* pass address and release memory */
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Pointer p has address 0x7fff1376cea0 and points to 0x55ffde405260
: Anonymous variable has the value 42 which is stored in 0x55ffde405260

In the example above you can see that the variable is anonymous because the value =42= is nowhere stored directly in a named variable but is retrieved by dereferencing the pointer that points to the memory location where =42= is stored (=*p=).

Not releasing allocated memory can lead to so called /memory leaks/ and is a frequent error cause. Another frequent error is trying to use anonymous variables that are already released (/dangling pointer/).

Helping advice to avoid the above errors:
- when you allocate memory with eg =malloc= immediately write the code to free the memory as well
- when releasing/freeing an anonymous variable assign it the (symbolic) value =NULL= which is defined in =stdlib.h=
  - it is guaranteed that there is never another variable at a location that is described by =NULL=
  - dereferencing =NULL= leads to a run time error
  - if functions like =malloc= fail they also return =NULL= therefore it is advised to check pointers against =null= before using them
*** Parameters
Parameters are the third way memory is allocated to store values. We covered this in the next lecture (lecture 07). (¬‿¬)
