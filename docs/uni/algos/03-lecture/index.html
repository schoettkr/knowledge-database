<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong> = A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term &ldquo;central processing unit&rdquo; at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term &ldquo;CPU&rdquo; refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.</li>
<li><strong>bit patterns</strong> / <strong>binary code</strong> = A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often the binary number system&rsquo;s 0 and 1. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc.</li>
<li><strong>core</strong> = A core is usually the basic computation unit of the CPU - it can run a single program context. A CPU may have one or more cores to perform tasks at a given time.</li>
<li><strong>processor design</strong> = refers to the way and scope that a core implements processor registers, control unit,  bus and  memory unit</li>
<li><strong>processor register</strong> = quickly accessible location available to a computer&rsquo;s cpu, common register sizes are 8, 32 or 64-bit register</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>An algorithm has to be interpretable to be executed by the computer. A (digital) processor can interpret bit patterns. <em>Bit patterns</em> are also called machine code. A <em>core</em> is a real implementation of an <em>processor design</em>. Processor designs differ in the way and scope that they implement <em>processor registers</em>, <em>control unit</em>,  <em>bus</em> and  <em>memory unit</em> (also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von%5FNeumann%5Farchitecture">Von Neumann Architecture</a>).</p>

<p>Different types of processors that implement mostly the same core design my be summarized as a &ldquo;<em>processor family</em>&rdquo;. A new processor family is formed when a processor design is considerably changed or altered (those are almost always backward compatible).</p>

<p>In machine code the bit pattern \[11111010\] for example is treated by the x86-processor-family as a directive to ignore interrupts.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-and-interpreter">Compiler and interpreter</h2>

<p>Since machine code is not so handy for humans, programming languages have been created that should help with that. Programming languages use different models and abstractions. There is (atleast) one <em>assembly language</em> that represents machine code in an easier to read manner (mnemonics). \(1111 1010\) (resp. \(0xFA\))* for example would be &ldquo;cli&rdquo; in assembly language for x86 processors (clear interrrupt flag). Programs are either <strong>translated</strong> into machine code or are <strong>interpreted</strong> by another program. This &ldquo;translation&rdquo; is done by the <strong>compiler</strong> while the interpretation is done by the <strong>interpreter</strong>.</p>

<p>&lowast; The 0 tells the parser it&rsquo;s dealing with a constant (and not an identifier/reserved word). Something is still needed to specify the number base HEX: the x is an arbitrary choice.</p>

<h2 id="c">C</h2>

<p>C is a programming language that is compiled into machine code without intermediate language representation (Zwischencode) or VM&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In this course we&rsquo;ll stick to the C99-standard. Since computers usually support multiple standards, the standard has to be set when compiling. C is &ldquo;close to the hardware&rdquo;. It is sometimes labeled as &ldquo;middle language&rdquo; eventhough it is still a high level programming language. Genereally a low level programming language is a language that provides no or little abstraction from a computer&rsquo;s instruction set architecture. Machine code and assembly language are usually counted as low level. However if you&rsquo;d for example compare C with Ruby or Php it would be the low level language in that comparison because it offers far less abstractions. That&rsquo;s why some say it is a &ldquo;middle language&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Usually C programs are really compact - they don&rsquo;t require a lot of overhead and storage. C is widely spread and presumably still the language in most of today&rsquo;s programs are writte.</p>

<p>It is possible to write really efficient C programs (not guaranteed though) and that&rsquo;s why the speed of C programs is often used as a benchmark when it comes to speed and/or efficiency.</p>

<p>In this course the <code>clang</code> compiler or the compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection (<code>gcc</code>) is used. For example like this <code>cc -std=c99 -Wall program.c -o program</code> or (<code>cc -std=c99 -Wall program.c -o program</code>). If the compilation was succesfull, the program can be executed like this <code>./program</code> and an return value (from the main method) could be retrived with <code>echo $?</code>.</p>

<h3 id="euclidian-algorithm-in-c">Euclidian Algorithm in C</h3>

<p>The Euclidian Algorithm may be used to find the Greates Common Divisor (GCD) of numbers greater than 0. What follows is an implementation of it in C code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">//static in this context means that the function is local and not exported to other modules
  static int euclid(int, int); // function declaration


  int main(void)
  {
    return euclid(45, 30);
  }

  int euclid(int x, int y) // function definition
  {
    if (x == y) return x;
    else if (x &gt; y) return euclid(x-y, y);
    else return euclid(x, y-x);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Because the function <code>euclid</code> is called in the main method before its defintion, it has to be declared before that so the compiler knows about it. If the function is <em>defined</em> <strong>before</strong> its first usage, the explicit declaration can be omitted.</p>

<p>Because it is common to use functions from different libraries or modules the declaration serves as an assurance to the compiler that a called function exists and may be called. Else a warning (<code>implicit-function-declaration</code>) would be triggered when compiling, eventhough the compilation might still be successfull.</p>

<p>This is risky because I can call the function without providing arguments for all the  parameters e.g <code>euclid(45);</code> and my program would compile just fine. That is until I run it and get a segmentation fault. In that case a declaration of the function interface would have saved me from the runtime error and thrown a compilation error instead.</p>

<h3 id="input-and-output-in-c">Input and Output in C</h3>

<p>Now we want to parameterize our euclidian algorithm (remember characteristic of an algorithm &rarr; should solve a batch of problems) and have an direct output, we need so called <em>library functions</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">// euclidian algorithm with IO
extern int printf(const char*, ...); // print format -&gt; write to output
extern int atoi(const char*); // ascii to integer
static int euclid(int, int);


int main(const int c, const char* v[])
{
  printf(&quot;c is %d\n&quot;, c); // number of command line arguments passed
  printf(&quot;v[0] is %s\n&quot;, v[0]); // path the program
  const char* arg1 = v[1]; // const because declared as const in the parameter list
  const char* arg2 = v[2];

  printf(&quot;GCD of %s and %s is %d.\n&quot;, arg1, arg2, euclid(atoi(arg1), atoi(arg2))); // formatter &quot;%s&quot; expects char*
  return 0;
}

int euclid(int x, int y)
{
  if (x == y) return x;
  else if (x &gt; y) return euclid(x-y, y);
  else return euclid(x, y-x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Read the comment and syntax carefully! Furthermore the functions <code>printf</code> and <code>atoi</code> are defined in C&rsquo;s standard library <code>stdlib</code> which is always linked by default (directive to include a library <code>#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>).</p>

<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>

<p>Depending on the position of an operator (e.g <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>%</code>, etc.) in regards to where the operator &ldquo;gets its operands&rdquo; it can be differentiated between:</p>

<ul>
<li>prefix operators (before an operand eg <code>++i</code> &rarr; <code>i</code> is incremented and then used)</li>
<li>postifx operators (after an operand eg <code>i++</code> &rarr; <code>i</code> is used and then incremented)</li>
<li>infix operators (between operands eg <code>5-2</code>)</li>
</ul>
