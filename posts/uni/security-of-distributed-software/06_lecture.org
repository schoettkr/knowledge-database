* Authentication
** Introduction
Authentication is the process of verficating if someone is the one who he claims to be. There are different kinds of authenticators:
- knowledge-based
  - PIN, passwords
  - Challenge-Response
- biometrics
  - fingerprint, iris, voice, signature, keystroke behavior
- ownership-based
  - something that you do not notice, but what is stored on a medium
  - IDs, magnetic cards, certificates, smart cards
- multi-factor authentication
  - combination of different types of authentication
  - 2 Factors: eg deposit card + PIN, credit card + signature, password + PIN sent by SMS
  - 3 Factors: eg password + smart card + fingerprint
    
*** Knowledge-based Authentication
Knowledge-based Authentication using passwords
- Alice agrees with Bob on a secret password p for authentication of Alice to Bob
- Bob applies a one-way or cryptographic hash function H on the password, and stores the image value H(p)
- when authenticating the password is send and then gets hashed again and compared to the stored hash
  
** Kerberos
Wiki: Kerberos is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

- works according to the KDC principle
- /User/ wants to use a certain service
- /Client/ is the local Kerberos application
- /Server/ provides the desired service
- /Authentication Server (AS)/ is used for primary user authentication
- Ticket Granting Server (TGS) issues tickets for certain services
- KDC includes AS and TGS
  
*** Accreditation
- User and his password are provided to the AS
- TGS and its secret key are also accredited by the AS
- Server and its secret key are made known to the TGS
  
See pages 5 - 12 for more on Kerberos

* Identity Information in Directory Services
- directory service is a special 'name service'
- property-based requests
  - comparison: full-name DNS request
  - similar to 'Yellow Pages'
- OSI X.500 is the 'classical' Directory Service
  - however the complex 'Directory Access Protocol' (DAP) prevented it from becoming more widespread
- LDAP = Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
  - standardized by IETF
