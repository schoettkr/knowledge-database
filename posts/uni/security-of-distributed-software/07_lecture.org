* Management of Access Rights
*Authorization* is the process of verification and access right assignment for a resource/service to a subject and is not to be confused with /Authentication/ which is the process of verificating claimed properties. Access Control is a process of access rights management and control.

*Access Matrix*\\
[[/knowledge-database/images/access-matrix.png]]
- group- and role-based access rights management:
  - complexity reduction by clustering users into 'role groups'
  - inheritance relationships in rights management
  - permissions based on roles
    
*Access Control Lists*\\
[[/knowledge-database/images/access-list.png]]
- /principal/ is a user, group or process that can be authenticated
- simply put: ACL is a set/list of resources, principals and corresponding access rights

*Access Control Models*\\
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
  - access rights are assigned per user
  - owner of a resource can pass his own rights
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
  - rights passing is not allowed
  - the system alone decides on which user has access to which resources
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - user could potentially be assigned multiple roles
  - access rights are role-based

** Realization in Operating Systems

Unix/Linux
- data/directories are associated to an inode descriptor (contains ID of the owner, ID of the group, ACL etc)
- assignment of rights to the file owner, group, everyone else
  
Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7
- permissions/restrictions can be assigned to individual users and groups
- security descriptors contain owner-ID, group-ID, Access Control Elements with Allow/Deny entries, logging operations
