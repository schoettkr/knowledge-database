*Part III: Trustworthy Software Engineering*\\

Trustworthy Software
- in Cordis.Europa.Eu security document defined as: Trustworthiness can be seen as software and infrastructure that is secure, reliable and resilient to attacks and operational failures; guaranteeing quality of service; protecting user data; ensuring privacy and providing usable and trusted tools to support the user in his/her security management. 
- trustworthiness needs to be considered from the outset rather than being addressed as add-on feature
  
So we focus on: Identity & Security By Design (SBD)
- who is it for?
- why does it matter?
- what is it all about?
- where does it apply?
- when to apply?
- how to apply?

* Identity (Chapter 1)
Internet as a danger zone in terms of identity
- what exactly needs to be protected?
- what should one orient towards?
- which data is exceptionally worthy of protection?
  
Security vs Identity
- for starters: keynote by Dick Hardt at WWW 2007 on "Identity 2.0"
- speech on identity by Kim Cameron

** Identity - Problem
- Kim Cameron: "The internet was built without a way to know who and what you are connecting to."
- initial situation:
  - internet services are left on their own
    - must provide security \rightarrow isolated identity solutions 
  - criminalization of internet
    - leads to loss of internet's credibility, for example drawback for e-businesses
  - identity layers are complex
    - successful attemps, such as SSL and Kerberos - however overall too many different scenarios are required, so agreement is difficult
      
Possible solution: Identity Metasystem
- such a system provides confidential support to ensure who is connecting to whom/what on the internet
- many questions:
  - who holds the data?
  - who trusts whom?
  - what scales?
  - how does one realize openness to new developments that do not yet exist?

** Identity - Identity in Detail
- there are numerous definitions of identity, the lecture is based on Kim Cameron's definition: "/Digital identity is a set of *claims*, which are made by a *digital subject* about self or other subjects./"
  - digital subject = person or thing (referred or real) in a digital realm that is described or with which one is dealing
    - "with which one is dealing" = often in the context with request/response model
    - example digital subject: real persons, devices, resources, rules/policies and relationships between digitial subjects
    - discussions of the 'subject' term extend into philosophy
  - claim = claim suggests that something is true, typically something that seems to be controversial or questionable
    - remark: claim is a relationship between a certain instance, a digital subject and an identity attribute

We must be able to *structure our understanding* of digital identity:
- we need a way to avoid returning to the *Empty Page* every time we talk about digital identity
- we need to inform peoples' thinking by teasing apart the factors and dynamics explaining the successes and failures of identity systems since the 1970s
- we need to develop hypotheses - resulting from observation - that are testable and can be disproved
- our goals must be pragmatic, bounding our inquiry, with the aim of defining the characteristics of an unifying identity metasystem
- the "*Laws of Identity*" offer a good way to express this thought
- beyond mere conversation, the Blogosphere offers us *a crucible*
  - the concept has been to employ this crucible to /harden and deepen the laws/

These definitions embrace Kerberos, X.509, SAML. They take this problem of the evaluation of the usefulness of a digital identity up to a higher level in the systems sense of multiple layers. These definitions separate the layer of where stuff is communicated from the layer where evaluations are done â€“ a very important step forward.

** Identity - Laws of Identity
1. *User Control and Consent*
   - /digital identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent/
     - systems need to appeal in their convenience & simplicity
     - constantly care about users' confidence
       - requires holistic commitment
       - user must be cetral to control with respect to which identities are used and which data is made public
       - system must protect from deception (eg website location and missue)
       - system must inform the user of possible consequences upon certain action (data sharing, login etc)
       - the holistic approach must be used as a paradigm in all contexts (eg when logging into a company or a private blog it should always be clear that the user consents to the release of certain)
2. *Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use*
   - /the solution that discloses the least identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable long term solution/
     - one should assume that data/information violations are unavoidable
     - to reduce risks, information use should be checked with respect to 2 strategies: "must be obtained" or "must be saved"
     - less information implies less value implies less risk
     - "as little as possible identification information" means:
       - reduction of linkable information
       - use of claim transformations
     - avoid unnecessary information storage for "possible future" use (why should a credit card be stored by the shop?)
     - the law is closely related to information disasters
3. *Justifiable Parties*
   - /Digital identity systems must limit disclosure of identifying information to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship/
     - user has to have a clear understanding of whom the information is/will be exchanged with
     - system itself may not draw conclusions about relationships between subject and parties (eg Microsoft Passport is useful for logging into MSN but why should it know if I login to Google or eBay?)
     - in which situations are regulatory identities required?
     - same holds for intermediaries (what should they know to achieve their goal)
     - all participants must submit statements of how the information will be used
4. *Directed Identity*
   - /a unifying identity metasystem must support both "omni-directional" identifiers for public entities and "unidirectional" identifiers for private entities
     - digital identity should always be viewed in the context of another identity or a set of identities
     - omni-directional = public entities require "beacons" (publicly known identifier or URI) \rightarrow eg websites (URLs) or public devices
     - uni-directional = private entities (people) require an ability not to be turned into a beacon
       - they require a unidirectional identifier, which can be used in combination with a trusted beacon (no correlation, eg user-bank interaction)
       - negative examples: bluetooth and RFID, partially WLAN
5. *Pluralism of Operators and Technologies*
   - /a unifying identity metasystem must channel and enable the inter-working of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers/
     - system may be ideal with respect to one characteristic, but not with respect to another
     - example: Authority vs Employer vs Individual
     - old and new technologies must be used and co-exist; identity system must not be in competition with technology, but must use it
     - technologies may have more growth than others (identity ecology)
6. *Human Integration*
   - /a unifying identity metasystem must define the human user as a component integrated through protected and unambiguous human-machine communications/
     - communication can be completely secure but what about the last two meters (off the screen and into the eyes of the viewer); does the user really know who it is he's communicating with?
       - phishing attacks are a good example of this
     - protocol for use of safety issues has to become a ceremony, absolutely predictable and controlled
       - example: communication in the cockpit (channel 9 on United Airlines)
7. *Consistent Experience Across Contexts*
   - /a unifying identity metasystem must provide a simple consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies/
     - simplicity and clarity are the main goal - identities have to be used in a similar fashion to all other things on the desktop
       - user must be able to see, verify, add and remove identities
     - which type of identity is acceptable in which context?
       - properties of such candidates are defined by the using parties
       - users must be able to recover the identity in the given context and understand which information is associated with it
       - person (human/legal) could possibly accept different types of identities
       - user must be able to choose the best identity in his opinion
