* Identity in the Light of Privacy, Security and Trust (Chapter 2)
- 7 Laws of Identity define requirements of dealing with identities
  - first focus on conceptual/basic understanding
- identity in global context has to comply with different levels
  - layered approach of identity management:
  - [[/knowledge-database/images/identity-layers.png]]
** Identity - Security - Privacy
- identity (in a digital setting) is often "only" closely linked to security, identity is more!
  - security = protect data from unauthorized access, removal, tampering
  - privacy = protect attributes, preferences, etc which are associated with identity, against unnecessary use by subject
  - identity is in relation to others \rightarrow attributes realize trust relation ships
** Identity & Trust
- Trust (wiki) = In a social context, trust has several connotations. Definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterised by the following aspects: One party (trustor) is willing to rely on the actions of another party (trustee); the situation is directed to the future. In addition, the trustor (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; he can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired
- *Trust = Conviction and belief in the sincerity, honesty and good intentions of another party with respect to a risk-prone action.*
*** Trust examples
- shopping with credit card, which trust relationships & risks exist?
  - identity and Credit Card company
  - identity and service
  - identity/service and card register
  - identity/service and money
- \rightarrow trust is always associated with risk
- trust is something one connects to a person
  - one cannot enforce trust by another person
*** Trust properties
- trust is rarely transitive
  - example: I trust Sara's taste in music, she, in turn, trusts Peter's - therefore I would possibly trust Peter in selecting music for my Birthday Party
- trust cannot be shared
  - example: A trusts B and C, which does not imply that B and C trust each other
- trust is not symmetric
  - example: if I trust you, you don't necessarily trust me in return
- trustworthiness cannot be self-declared ("trust me!")
- trust is a value closely related to evidence
  - buying a brand computer which is more expensive because I trust the brand
  - Computer allows access upon login, since the provided evidence (login/password) serve as proof
- trust is hard to quantify
  - I trust Sara more than Peter - what does that mean?
  - in business context trust can be evaluated against risks (given obvious risk levels)
  - otherwise a contract is used as a basis: analysis is required, risks are evaluated and thereby cotractual relationships are defined; leads to Service Level Agreements (SLA) providers and users
- Trust by reputation
  - trust in a person can develop from other people's statements about him/her (Communities of Trust)
  - examples:
    - all security experts advise caution when traveling in the following countries
    - ebay: one buys a product from a handler he doesnt know, but which has good reviews (high reputation)
** Identity & Privacy
- privacy is an important and complicated topic (tightly coupled with data protection)
- identity and privacy are closely related
  - what does privacy mean for a person?
    - generally: private data shouldn't become public
    - however, often: private data disclosure is ok if it yields considerable benefits
  - privcacy must be observed in context
    - eg discount systems: provide us your address and date of birth and we'll give you a 15% discount
- privacy is partially legally regulated
  - eg Federal Data Protection Act, European Data Protection Directive, Patriot Act
- conclusion in legal context: own applications systems must take identity and privacy into account (see Laws of Identity)
  - embed the concepts of identity and privacy in design
  - use of identity and privacy-relevant information must be comprehensible, verifiable and reportable at any point in time
  - identity management system or an identity metasystem must be able to answer questions on identity privacy terms
  - legal requirements forcte system operators to testify on privacy policy
    - eg webshop sends cookies to customers, what should the privacy policy say? (eg We use cookies)
- privacy principle - respect privacy
  - accountability
  - identifying purposes
  - requirement of affected person's consent
  - minimal privacy data collection (time limit)
  - limitations of use
  - data collection accuracy
  - protection
  - access to personal data (to the owner)
  - comprehensible regulations
      
* Identity Management Systems (Chapter 3)
- what is needed for identity implemenation?
  - some kind of *identity metasystem* \rightarrow contains 3 certain roles (can be more)
  - *identity provider*
    - person or an organization, which creates digital identities, either for themselves or on behalf, eg online shop could create identities for customers, authorities provide identities for their employees
  - *relying party* (human/legal person)
    - person or organization, which requires digital identity before allowing entry/acess
    - example: users willing to revoke a contract - the relying party defines which claims are required in order to execute cancellation, as well as which formats and credentials are accepted
  - *digital subject*
    - individual or entity for which claims are made

Definition *Identity Management*: "Identity management is the set of processes, tools and social contracts surrounding the creation, maintenance and termination of a digital Identity for people or, more generally, for systems and services to enable secure access to an expanding set of systems and applications."
