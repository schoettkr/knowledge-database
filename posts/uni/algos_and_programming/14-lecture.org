* Design and Correctness of Algorithms 
** Pseudocode
As we've learnt in the last lecture /pseudocode/ is one of the most popular semiformal specification languages.

Pseudocode generally defines a set of instructions, there are no strict rules on how pseudocode needs to look like, therefore there are many forms of it, which is okay as long as it is intuitively readable.

Example pseudocode for the Euclidian Algorithm:

#+ATTR_HTML: :style background:lightgrey;
*Require:* A, B \in N, A > 0 \cap B > 0\\
*Ensure:* a = b = gcd(A, B)\\
a \leftarrow A; b \leftarrow B\\
*while* a \neq b *do*\\
   *if* a < b *then*\\
      b \leftarrow b - a\\
   *else*\\
      a \leftarrow a - b\\
   *end if*\\
*end while*\\

The slides note at this point that in the future we'll often look at algorithms in pseudo code.

** Correctness
When you find an approach for a problem / an algorithm, the /correctness/ has to be validated.

It is advised to verify the correctness of the idea first and then the correctness of the concrete algorithm.
The correctness of an idea cannot be verified formally, but the following things should be pondered:
- does the idea work /in general/ or just for a /specific case/?
- are there /special cases/ in which the idea does not work out? are these relevant?
- try finding an /counter-example/
- what about /extreme cases/?

What follows on slides 25-30 are some example problems and ideas to solve them, take a look there if you want.

As stated before the correctness of the concrete algorithm also has to be validated. There are in general two ways to do this:
- *Exhaustive Testing*
  - verify that there is no incorrect behaviour in the implementation of the algorithm by testing/executing it with all possible data inputs/combinations
  - Problems:
    - usually this is /impossible/ since the possible data combinations are really large or even infinite
    - /partial testing/ may boost the confidence in regards to the correctness of a program/algorithm, but does not replace a proof
    - a good selection of test cases is difficult
- *Correctness Proof* (Korrektheitsbeweis)
  - verify correct behaviour via mathematical methods/proofs
  - Problems:
    - are difficult or impossible on the level of implementation because of lacking formalization
    
To proof the correctness it can be performed on a more /abstract level/ instead. Mistakes are then however possible when performing the concrete implementation. We'll continue to look at proofs and not tests.

** Proofs
Slides: Informale Definition = Ein Beweis ist eine Herleitung einer Aussage aus bereits bewiesenen Aussagen und/oder Grundannahmen (Axiomen)

We know a few different (but still combinable) methods for proofs:
- *deduction*
  - classical proof via combination of premises
  - eg: all humans are mortal(premise 1) & all kings are humans (premise 2) \rightarrow all kings are mortal (conclusion/deduction)
  - the correctness of the premises has to be given axiomatically or already been proven
- *complete case analysis/differentiation* (vollständige Fallunterscheidung)
  - when there are a finite amount of cases/variants then each one can be inspected individually
  - if a statement is true for /every/ case/variant then the statement is true as a whole
  - eg: "all odd integers in the intervall [2^1, 2^3] are prime numbers" (statement) \rightarrow 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime \rightarrow statement is true
- *complete /transfinite induction*
  - base cases (Induktionsanker/-anfang IA) show that a statement is valid for a special (smallest/first) case (often \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\))
  - step case / inductive step (Induktionsschritt)
    - assume that the statement holds true for \(n=k\) (Induktionsvoraussetzung IV) and prove that then the statements holds for \(n=k+1\); proof that the /induction hypothesis/ follows from the /induction requirement/
    - Induktionsschluss \rightarrow inference (Folgerung) that the statement holds for all cases starting at the first
- *indirect proof*
  - assume the opposite of the hypothesis/statement and find a disproof via axioms and proven concepts \rightarrow inference that the assumption is wrong and therefore the hypothesis/statment is true
** Proofs of Algorithms
To prove an algorithm you have to ask two questions. 1) What is there to be proven (Specification)? 2.) What is already known?

A distinction is made between 2 kinds of "correctness":
- *partial correctness*
  - an algorithm is /partially correct/ if an answer is returned that this answer will be correct (slides: ein Algorithmus is partiell korrekt, wenn er für eine spezifizerte erfüllte Vorbedingung Q bei einer eventuellen/möglichen Terminierung eine spezifizerte Nachbedingung R erreicht, dh R is nach Ausführung erfüllt)
- *total correctness*
  - total correctness requires additionally to partial correctness that the algorithm *terminates*
    
So, /if/ a partial correct algorithm terminates he yields a correct result and a total correct algorithm yields the correct result after a finite amount of time. 

# In the next lecture/post we look a sorting algorithms and how/what kind of correctness we can prove there :P
*** Proving Sort Algorithms
We already got to know a sorting algorithm in one of the first lectures (bubble sort). The correctness of a solution to the problem of sorting can be expressed independently from the algorithm: Input = sequence of elements (e_1, e_2, ..., e_n) \rightarrow Output = permutation (e'_1, e'_2, ..., e'_n) of (e_1, e_2, ..., e_n) so that e'_1 \leq e'_2 \leq ... \leq e'_n

The bubble sort algorithm would look like this in pseudocode:

#+ATTR_HTML: :style background:lightgrey;
*Require:* e_1, ..., e_n\\
*Ensure:* \forall i \in {1, n-1}, e_i \leq e_{i+1}\\
#+ATTR_HTML: :style background:lightgrey;
*repeat*\\
  /changed/ \leftarrow false\\
  *for* /i/ \leftarrow 1, ..., /n/-1 *do*\\
   *if* e_i > e_{i+1} *then*\\
    SWAP(e_i, e_{i+1})\\
    /changed/ \leftarrow true\\
   *end if*\\
  *end for*\\
*until* /changed/ = false\\
 
Proving the /partial correctness/ is simple: If this algorithm terminates /changed/ has to be /false/ which implicates that for no i \in {1, ..., n-1} this e_i > e_{i+1} can be true which in reverse means that \forall i \in {1, ..., n-1}, e_i \leq e_{i+1}

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort][/Insertion Sort/]] is an alternative algorithm to solve the sorting problem. This is the corresponding pseudocode:

#+ATTR_HTML: :style background:lightgrey;
*Require:* e_1, ..., e_n\\
*Ensure:* \forall i \in {1, n-1}, e_i \leq e_{i+1}\\
#+ATTR_HTML: :style background:lightgrey;
*for* j \leftarrow 2, ..., n *do*\\
  /key/ \leftarrow e_j\\
  /i/ \leftarrow j-1\\
  *while* (/i/ > 0) \wedge (e_i > key) *do*\\
   e_{i+1} \leftarrow e_i           ; move all elements that are greater than /key/ right\\
   i \leftarrow i-1\\
  *end while*\\
  e_i+1 \leftarrow key          ; fill the gap with /key/\\
*end for*

Take a look at slides 47 - 50 (chapter 7) for details on how to prove the correctness of insertion sort with lemmas.

** Soundness (Korrektheitskalküle)
Proofs like the one we saw for bubble sort are /ad hoc/. There are/is a special logic/calculus (Kalküle \rightarrow formales System zum Ziehen logischer Schlüsse) in regards to the correctness of programs, for example the *FLoyd-Hoare logic* (Hoare-Kalkül) or the *wp-Kalkül* (Edsger Dijkstra).

These logics/calculus use triples: {Precondition} Code {Postcondition}. There are axiomatic rules: \frac{premise}{consequence}

** Termination
*Partial Correctness* is proven under the assumption that the code /terminates/. Therefore termination has to be proven to prove *total correctness*. This is especially critical when dealing with recursion (abort after finite steps and reach the recursion base) and loops (loop condition has to evaluate to false after finite steps and the loop body also has to terminate in each iteration).

To prove termination of a loop a *termination function* \tau (Tau) has to be specified:
$$ \tau : V \rightarrow \mathbb{N} $$

The termination function has to have the following characteristics:
- its values are natural numbers (including 0)
- each iteration resp. execution of the loop body *reduces* its value (strictly monotonically decreasing)
- the loop condition is /false/ when \tau = 0
- \tau is the upper boundary for the loop iterations that are left

If a termination function is known a *termination rule* can be used:
[[/knowledge-database/images/termination-rule.png ]]

So *if* a termination function is /strictly monotonically decreasing/ *and* the value 0 leads to the end of the loop *and* the loop body terminates, *then* the loop *terminates*

So this has to be shown:
1. strictly monotonically decrease of \tau
2. the implication that the loop condition B is not met at the lowest \tau
3. the termination of the body P

Example of a termination function for a loop that calculates the square of a nonnegative integer:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  /* { Input: 0 <= a} */
  int y = 0;
  int x = 0;

  while (y != a) {
    x = x + 2*y + 1;
    y = y + 1;
   }

  /* { Output: x = a^2} */
#+END_SRC
Pick the termination function \tau = a - y
1. \tau is decremented in each iteration, since 'y' is incremented and 'a' is constant
2. if \tau = 0 then y = a therefore the loop condition y != a evaluates to /false/
3. the loop body does not contain recursions, gotos or other loops, termination is therefore trivial

\rightarrow The loop terminates!

To prove the termination of recursions the same procedure as with loops can be applied. A termination function \tau is created that gets smaller with increasing recursion depth. The following has to apply:
1. the values are natural numbers (incl 0)
2. the value of \tau decreases with each method call (recursion)
3. discontinuation is forced at \tau = 0 (or earlier)
 
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  /* Fibonacci Example */
  int fib(int n) {
    if (n < 3) return 1;
    else return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
  }
#+END_SRC


However proving termination is not always possible (eg golbachs conjecture for expressing integers as sum of primes)
