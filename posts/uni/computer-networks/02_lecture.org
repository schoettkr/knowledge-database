*Back to the roots of the Internet*\\
The internet consists of
- a set of computers which
  - use the same network protocol (TCP/IP)
  - are somehow (directly or indirectly) connected to each other
  - offer or use certain services
- a set of (human or technical) users which access and use services
- and a set of further networks accessible via gateways
  
The most commonly used Internet services are:
- World Wide Web (www)
  - platform for hypermedial information exchange
  - based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Email
  - exchange of multimedial messages
  - based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- File Exchange
  - access and transmission of files
  - based on File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Network Management
  - surveillance and control of connected systems
  - based on Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
