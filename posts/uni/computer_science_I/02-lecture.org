There wasn't much new stuff in this lecture because a wrong announcement was made leading to students missing the first week's lecture. Therefore we did mostly repetitions that I'll skip now and summarize the additional slides.

* Data types in C++
The data type constitutes three things:
- memory mapping
- codomain/target set (Wertevorrat)
- valid operations

Standard data types:
- =int= = whole integers, usually 4 byte
- =float= = real numbers, usually 4-8 byte
- =char= = character (in single quotes!), usually 1 byte
- =bool= logical/boolean values (true and false)
  
  
** Type conversion
Type conversion is done by calling the type on the object:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
int one = 1;
float(one)/2;
=> 0.5
#+END_SRC
