* Characteristics of a language
Languages consist of three main characteristics:
1. Lexis (specification on formation of words)
2. Syntax (specification on formation of sentences)
3. Semantic (meaning)
   
** Lexis and lexical elements of C++
- keywords: =if=, =else=
- predefined identifiers: =int=, =char=
- identifiers: =temp1=, =diff=
  - have to start with a letter (=_= is allowed aswell)
  - can then contain arbitrary amount of characters/numbers
  - are case sensitive
- special symbols:  ; , : . + − ∗ / % > < = ! ˜ ˆ & | [ ] { } ( )
- separators: whitespace, tabulator, newline
- numeric values:
  - decimal: =255=
  - octal: =377=
  - hexadecimal: =0xff=
  - floats: =1.5= or =3.1e-15=
- characters: ='a'=, ='#'=, ='\n'= (in single quotes!)
- strings: ="Test 1 \n"= (in double quotes!)
- comments: 
  - =//= until end of line
  - =/* ... */= multiple lines
   

** Syntax and presentation method (Darstellungsmittel)
A method to present syntax is to use syntax diagrams. They represent a graphical alternative to e.g Backus–Naur form to represent formal or context-free grammar.
*** Elements of syntax diagrams
- ▭ a rectangle with sharp corners represents an abstract entity
- ▢ a ellipse (rectangle with rounded corners) represents a concrete term of the language, therefore an element of the lexis
- ⟶  an arrow indicates the flow direction (to build "sentences")

* Boolean algebra, logical connectives and truth tables
C++ has the data type =bool= which can either be =true= or =false=. In integers a =0= is =false= and everything =≠0= is =true=.

| a     | b     | a && b | a ‖ b |
|-------+-------+--------+-------|
| false | false | false  | false |
| true  | false | false  | true  |
| false | true  | false  | true  |
| true  | true  | true   | false |

There is also the =!= not operator to negate boolean values.

Using these boolean operators in C++, yields values of type =bool= (\rightarrow =true= or =false=)

** Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT
In digital computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, directly supported by the processor, and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations. 

These are the bitwise operators in C++ =|=, =&=, =~= and =^=.

What is really important to understand is, that bitwise operators operate on the single bits (in comparison to boolean operators who operate on the whole value and yield true or false and are not bitwise operators!).

*** Bitwise NOT
The bitwise NOT, or complement, is a unary operation that performs logical negation on each bit, forming the ones' complement of the given binary value. Bits that are 0 become 1, and those that are 1 become 0. For example
#+BEGIN_SRC org
~0111
= 1000
#+END_SRC
Comparing bitwise NOT to boolean NOT (the last letter indicates the number system e.g =d= = decimal, =b= = binary):
#+BEGIN_SRC org
boolean NOT: !1_d = 0_d; !5_d = 0_d
bitwise NOT: ~1_d = 0_d; ~5_d = ~0101_b = 1010_b = 10_d 
#+END_SRC

*** Bitwise OR
A bitwise OR takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 0 if both bits are 0, while otherwise the result is 1. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
0101 | 0011
= 0111
#+END_SRC
The bitwise OR shall not be confused with the boolean OR that treats its operands as boolean values and returns such.
The bitwise OR can be used to manage flags if a program has to handle a lot of booleans and the memory is really limited. Each bit of a binary number could itself represent a boolean value (eg =0= = false, =1= true).

For example =0010= may be seen as a list of flags where the first, second and fourth flag is not set (=0=), while the third flag is set (=1=). To set the first flag, this bit string can be combined with another bitstring that has a =1= in the first place:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  0010
| 1000
= 1010
#+END_SRC

*** Bitwise AND
A bitwise AND takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits, which is equivalent to multiplying them. Thus, if both bits in the compared position are 1, the bit in the resulting binary representation is 1 (1 × 1 = 1); otherwise, the result is 0 (1 × 0 = 0 and 0 × 0 = 0). For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
    0101 (decimal 5)
&   0011 (decimal 3)
  = 0001 (decimal 1)
#+END_SRC
The operation may be used to determine whether a particular bit is /set/ (1) or /clear/ (0). For example, given a bit pattern =0011= (decimal 3), to determine whether the second bit is set we use a bitwise AND with a bit pattern containing 1 only in the second bit:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
    0011 (decimal 3)
&   0010 (decimal 2)
  = 0010 (decimal 2)
#+END_SRC
Because the result =0010= is non-zero, we know the second bit in the original pattern was set. This is often called bit masking. (By analogy, the use of masking tape covers, or masks, portions that should not be altered or portions that are not of interest. In this case, the 0 values mask the bits that are not of interest.)

The bitwise AND may be used to clear selected bits (or flags) of a register in which each bit represents an individual Boolean state. This technique is an efficient way to store a number of Boolean values using as little memory as possible.

For example, =0110= (decimal 6) can be considered a set of four flags, where the first and fourth flags are clear (0), and the second and third flags are set (1). The second bit may be cleared by using a bitwise AND with the pattern that has a zero only in the second bit:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
    0110 (decimal 6)
&   1011 (decimal 11)
  = 0010 (decimal 2)
#+END_SRC

The bitwise AND can be used to check the parity(Parität, gerade ungerade) of a binary number, by checking the value of the lowest valued bit (=1_d=) which would be =1_b= if the number is odd:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
    0110 (decimal 6)
AND 0001 (decimal 1)
  = 0000 (decimal 0) -> even
  
    0101 (decimal 5)
AND 0001 (decimal 1)
  = 0001 (decimal 1) -> odd

    0100 (decimal 4)
AND 0001 (decimal 1)
  = 0000 (decimal 0) -> even
#+END_SRC

*** Bitwise XOR
In addition to =or= and =and= there is also =xor= (exclusive or \rightarrow only one value true):
| a     | b     | a XOR b |
|-------+-------+---------|
| false | false | false   |
| true  | false | true    |
| false | true  | true    |
| true  | true  | false   |
The bitwise =XOR= operator in C++ is =^=.

A bitwise XOR takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 or only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. In this we perform the comparison of two bits, being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
    0101 (decimal 5)
XOR 0011 (decimal 3)
  = 0110 (decimal 6)
#+END_SRC

The bitwise XOR may be used to invert selected bits in a register (also called toggle or flip). Any bit may be toggled by XORing it with 1. For example, given the bit pattern =0010= (decimal 2) the second and fourth bits may be toggled by a bitwise XOR with a bit pattern containing 1 in the second and fourth positions:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
    0010 (decimal 2)
XOR 1010 (decimal 10)
  = 1000 (decimal 8)
#+END_SRC
This technique may be used to manipulate bit patterns representing sets of Boolean states.

Assembly language programmers and optimizing compilers sometimes use XOR as a short-cut to setting the value of a register to zero. Performing XOR on a value against itself always yields zero, and on many architectures this operation requires fewer clock cycles and memory than loading a zero value and saving it to the register (german: Wendet man XOR auf zwei identische Operanden an, so erhält man immer 0. In vielen Architekturen benötigt diese Operation weniger Rechenzeit, als man für das Laden einer 0 und das Speichern im Register benötigt).

** Bitwise shifting / bit shifts
The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. Registers in a computer processor have a fixed width, so some bits will be "shifted out" of the register at one end, while the same number of bits are "shifted in" from the other end.

The operator =<<= shifts to the left by the following value and =>>= shifts to the right by the following value. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
0110 (6 in decimal) << 1 = 1100 (12 in decimal)
#+END_SRC
So =6 << 1 = 12= because the underlying bits are moved/shifted by 1 place to the left. Shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So =6 << 1= is equivalent to =6 * 2=, and =6 << 3= is equivalent to =6 * 2^3 = 6 * 8=. A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible.

A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left, they simply move to the right. For example, shifting the number 12:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
1100 (12 in decimal) >> 1 = 0110 (6 in decimal)
#+END_SRC
That will get us back our original 6. So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2.

But attention: If the variable ch contains the bit pattern =11100101=, then =ch >> 1= will produce the result =01110010=, and =ch >> 2= will produce =00111001=.
Here blank spaces are generated simultaneously on the left when the bits are shifted to the right. When performed on an *unsigned type*, the operation performed is a logical shift, causing the blanks to be filled by =0s= (zeros). When performed on a *signed type*, the result is technically undefined and compiler dependent, however most compilers will perform an arithmetic shift, causing the blank to be filled with the sign bit of the left operand which might be =1s= (ones).

From stackoverflow: Shifts on unsigned types are well defined (as long as the right operand is in non-negative and less than the width of the left operand), and they always zero-fill.

Shifts (or any bitwise operations) on signed types are generally not a good idea. If the left operand is negative then << has undefined behavior, and >> yields an implementation-defined result (meaning that the compiler has to document what it does, but there's no way for you to control it). For non-negative values of a signed type, the result is what you'd expect -- as long as it doesn't overflow (if it overflows, the behavior is undefined).


Another example:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
a = 1000 in decimal = 0000 0011 1110 1000 in binary
b = 3
a << b = 0001 1111 0100 0000 in binary = 8000 in decimal
a >> b = 0000 0000 0111 1101 in binary = 125 in decimal
#+END_SRC

There is also a difference between logical, arithmetic and circular shifting that you may want to look up. 

Also note that the "<<" ">>" as a stream operator takes precedence over bit shifting so the following code:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
int a, b;
a = 1;
b = 5;
cout << b << a << endl;
#+END_SRC
Would yield =51=. To have it bitshifted one has to add parentheses:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
int a, b;
a = 1;
b = 5;
cout << (b << a) << endl;
#+END_SRC
Which would yield =10= because b is leftshifted by a (=n=) which is equal to a multiplication with 2^n and this case =a= is =1= so =b= is multiplcated by 2 which gives 10.
