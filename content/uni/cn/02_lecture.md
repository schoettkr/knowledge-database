**Back to the roots of the Internet**<br />
The internet consists of

-   a set of computers which
    -   use the same network protocol (TCP/IP)
    -   are somehow (directly or indirectly) connected to each other
    -   offer or use certain services
-   a set of (human or technical) users which access and use services
-   and a set of further networks accessible via gateways

The most commonly used Internet services are:

-   World Wide Web (www)
    -   platform for hypermedial information exchange
    -   based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
-   Email
    -   exchange of multimedial messages
    -   based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
-   File Exchange
    -   access and transmission of files
    -   based on File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
-   Network Management
    -   surveillance and control of connected systems
    -   based on Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
