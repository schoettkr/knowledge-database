This post will be rather short (the CS posts usually are shorter anyway) because I already covered some of the stuff in the last post by accident because I wasn't able to attend the lecture and overestimated our progress.


## Development Cycle {#development-cycle}

Typically you don't hear the task/problem and start writing code immediately. Because usually real world problems are not trivial. Here's an outline of how things should/may go:

**Specification** (input = task/problem; resolve conflicts & misunderstandings; output = functional requirements) &rarr; **Design** (Entwurf; input = functional requirements; output = design) &rarr; **Implementation** (input = design output = source code) &rarr; **Compilation** (input = source code; possibly throw errors; output = executable)

All the above steps stand in correlation to each other meaning the arrows could go in both directions because you often have to go back to a previous step before continuing.

The rest of the lecture was about how we can **specify** and **design**. It covered pseudocode, structograms, PAP and so on... I cba to repeat this stuff here. If you want to take a look feel free to do so in the slides from page 60 till 64.

Next week we'll probably cover the next step  of **"Implementation"** which may or may not be more interesting as the others at this high level view..
