This was the first lecture in the new summer semester and therefore it was mostly about organizational stuff. Here are the most important points:

-   the exam is gonna be a written one and might be open-book
-   the start of the tutorials will be announced on the course website sometime in April (registration via opal)
-   there are gonna be exercises to hand in
    -   those can be found [here](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/auth/RepositoryEntry/19946340368/CourseNode/86516925533323)
